        <p>
          This website critiques how we are tracked on social media and across the modern web. Distracted by
          cute design and entertaining content, we are lulled unaware of how much information we are sharing
          with international advertising companies, how closely they follow our mouse movements, how intimately
          they know our histories.
          <br><br>

        <h2>Fingerprints</h2>
        <p>
          Browser fingerprinting involves collecting information about your device that 
          can be used to uniquely identify and track you across multiple websites, without cookies.
          To see what information can be gathered, <a href="https://amiunique.org/fp" target="_blank">take a test on amiunique.org</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website harvests the browser fingerprint of every participant that visits it,
          adding a unique flower to the garden based on their fingerprint data. The website
          is networked to other devices in real time, with each device represented as a character 
          model textured depending on their fingerprint. Ghostly transparent characters are devices 
          that have visited the site in the past, now held in the server database. These vibrant 3D models 
          show the uniqueness of our browser fingerprints, all living in a context of constant surveillance.

        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p id="desktop-controls">
          Use the left mouse button to rotate the camera, the right mouse button to track, 
          and the scrollwheel to zoom. Double click anywhere on the ground to move the fingerprint 
          character about the garden, double click on an empty bench to sit down.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p id="mobile-controls">
          Touch and move to rotate the camera, use two fingers to track, 
          and pinch in and out to zoom. Double tap anywhere on the ground to move the fingerprint 
          character about the garden, double tap on an empty bench to sit down.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          Made with Three.js for 3D modelling, fingerprint.js for browser fingerprinting and Tween.js for animations.
          The server and API of this website is hosted using the free Backendless Springboard development plan, 
          and website is hosted and published via Cloudflare Pages.
